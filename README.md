# Tsunami
An _intuitive_ Torrent client based on _Libtorrent_ with _innovative_ features like _Streaming_ and *Search*   
###Collaboration
We are currently setting up the team voluntiers who will develop the software. We accept pull request. Just look at what is need in the tolist-dev.txt
###Compile
The solution (.sln) is able to get all prerequisites and libs need (in form af nuget packages) to get an executable of the project, automatically after compile. Just set the UI you want to launch from your Visual Studio 2015 Community and enjoy!
Simplicity is the main goal.
